# Programming Language Preferences

**Questions:** Is there a programming language preference in industry fields that computer scientists have created? How has the needs of developers or engineers been reflected by the creation of new programming languages? Will their ever be a unniversal programming language or protocol that will fill most of if not all the needs of everyone? Why are there different programming languages in the first place and not a language that has been carefully updated with features?

### Programming Preferences in industry fields
**Web Development:**
**JavaScript:** Dominant on the client side for web applications. Created by Brendan Eich, a computer programmer.
**Python and Ruby:** Popular for server-side web development due to their simplicity and powerful frameworks like Django and Ruby on Rails. Python was developed by Guido van Rossum, a computer scientist.

**Enterprise Software:**

**Java:** Widely used for building large-scale, cross-platform applications. Created by James Gosling, a computer scientist.
**C#:** Preferred in Microsoft-centric environments for enterprise solutions. Developed by Anders Hejlsberg and his team at Microsoft.
Data Science and Machine Learning:

**Python:** Preferred for its extensive libraries like TensorFlow and Pandas.
**R:** Specialized for statistical analysis and data visualization. Created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, both statisticians and computer scientists.
Systems Programming:

**C and C++:** Used for operating systems, game development, and performance-critical applications. C was developed by Dennis Ritchie, and C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup, both computer scientists.

**Mobile Development:**

**Swift:** Used for iOS app development. Created by Apple engineers, including Chris Lattner, a computer scientist.
Kotlin: Preferred for Android development. Developed by JetBrains programmers, including Dmitry Jemerov and Andrey Breslav.
Embedded Systems and IoT:

**C and C++:** Common due to low-level hardware access and efficiency.
**Rust:** Gaining popularity for safety and concurrency features. Created by Graydon Hoare, a computer scientist.
Financial Services:

**Java and C++:** Used for high-performance trading systems.
Python: Employed for quantitative analysis and algorithmic trading.
### Needs of Programmers reflected through Programming languages

**Enhanced Productivity and Readability:**
Simplifying Syntax: Python as a very readable syntax that is quite attractive for many new programmers and helps with code review.  

Example: Python has a quite extensive keyword list that helps the program flow almost like natural language. 
Like and instead of && as well as or instead of ||. 

**Performance and Efficiency:**
Low-Level Control: Languages like C and C++ were developed at bell labs to give the user more control over system resources, which is used in performance heavy applications.

Example: Game engines and high-frequency trading systems often use C++ for its performance capabilities.

**Safety and Reliability**
Memory Safety: Languages like Rust were developed to make memory management less risky without sacrificing performance.

Example: Rust has a feature known as Ownership that helps manage memory through a set of rules that that the compilr checks.  

**Specialized Domain Needs:**
Statistical Analysis: R was created specifically for statisticians, providing tools tailored for data analysis and visualization.

Example: R's extensive libraries for statistical tests and models make it a go-to for data scientists.
Web Development: PHP was designed for web development, embedding directly into HTML.

Example: PHP's ease of integration with web servers made it popular for server-side scripting.
**Cross-Platform Compatibility**
Write Once, Run Anywhere: Java was developed with the philosophy of cross-platform compatibility via the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Example: Java applications can run on any device equipped with a JVM, reducing platform-specific issues.
Interoperability: Kotlin was designed to interoperate fully with Java, allowing developers to use both languages within the same project.

Example: Android development can mix Java and Kotlin code seamlessly.
## Unniversal Programming Language
From my research it seems that each programming language abstracts different features that fit's the needs of it user's. It is very unlikely that a unniversal programming language will come about. Although their are talks of some new programming languages replacing legacy languages, no one language can fit the needs of every developer. Even the very popular python programming language can't offer the low level abstraction of memory management that c or c++ offers. It would be quite difficult to learn a single language with so many features. 
## Different Languages
With the needs of developers and engineers changing new languages like Go and Rust, which offer better concurrency and safety features have emerged to fill those needs. 
It can be quite costly to continuously update a language without running into conflicts and bugs. Having different languages allows for developers to fit their needs easier.
